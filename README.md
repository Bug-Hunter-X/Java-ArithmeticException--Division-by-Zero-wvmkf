# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Java: the `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero.

The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to divide an integer by zero.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential exception.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Java applications.  Always check for potential exceptions, particularly those related to division, to prevent unexpected program termination.
